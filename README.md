# Ontotext GraphQL Playground Component

The **Ontotext GraphQL Playground Component** is a reusable web component built with [StencilJS](https://stenciljs.com/) that provides an interface for exploring and interacting with GraphQL APIs. Designed for use in Ontotextâ€™s GraphDB Workbench and other applications, it leverages the power of [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) while maintaining framework-agnostic reusability.
